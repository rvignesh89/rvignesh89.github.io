A warm welcome to my blog!

This is my third attempt at creating my personal blog! First attempt was during final year in college. I was learning some really cool stuff(functional programming!) and wanted to share it everyone. But being the lazy ass that I am, never really made it beyond the dream of doing it...

Second time was not bad. Half way through Liverpool's title winning(*cough cough* almost) season of 2014/15, was motivated to write my own review of the matches every week. Of course my ambitions were cruelly killed like our title hopes that year. After that never ever thought about reviewing our matches because every game was the same old promise followed by shock followed by disdain. Lets see if #kloppmani can review my interests in this again.

Nevertheless I think the third time is going to be different. Especially given I'm blogging using Jekyll which is incredibly cool! It feels like coding rather than blogging when you are doing it from atom! Also because there are some things that I'm learning these days that writing about my opinions seems invigorating!

So lets see how it goes this time!
